# Baremetal Snippets for Microchip SAM D and SAM L series of MCUs

Repo contains baremetal snippets for SAM D and SAM L series microcontrollers. I wrote most the snippets while learning SAM series MCUs from Atmel/Microchip. 

ASF is not the best thing out there, so for people looking to make their own drivers this should be very helpful.

## Contributions 

I am open to take community contributions, if you have working snippets, add some helpfull comments and raise a pull request. 

## Improvements

All the snippets above are tested standalone with toolchain and device header or with a ASF dumy project. If you find any bugs in the snippets register the bug, I will try to fix it.
